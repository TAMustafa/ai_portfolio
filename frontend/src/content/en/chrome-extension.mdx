Applying for jobs can be frustrating — you tailor your CV, send out dozens of applications, and often hear nothing back. 
One reason is that many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter candidates. 
If your CV doesn’t align with the job description, it may never even reach a recruiter’s desk.

That’s where this project comes in. I built a Chrome extension that helps candidates instantly check how well their CV matches a job description and highlights gaps they could address. 
It’s a practical tool for anyone trying to make their applications more effective.

### How it works

- Paste or upload a CV and a job description directly in the extension.
- The text is securely sent to the backend API for analysis.
- The tool highlights key skills, keywords, and experience matches (and mismatches).

### Tech Stack

**Frontend (Chrome Extension)**
- JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- Manifest V3 for modern extension security and performance
- Simple UI for seamless in-browser use

**Backend (API)**
- FastAPI (Python) for scalable endpoints
- NLP-driven comparison to detect relevant keywords and skills  
- Packaged with Docker for easy deployment

### Why this project?
The job market is competitive, and many applications are screened by algorithms before a human even sees them. 
This tool helps candidates get closer to "ATS-friendly" CVs by giving instant feedback on alignment with job postings.

Introduce the project. Describe the problem, approach, and results.

## Challenge
Multiple sales channels (webshop, marketplace, retail) without a single source of truth caused:

- Double selling and overselling
- Manual reconciliation work
- Lost revenue due to inaccurate on-hand inventory

<Callout type="warning" title="Key pain">
Parallel orders across channels created inconsistencies within minutes.
</Callout>

## Solution
We implemented an event-driven sync layer. Every sale, return, or adjustment emits an event processed by a lightweight worker. The worker normalizes data and updates a single source of truth.

```ts
// Example: order consumer (simplified)
type OrderEvent = { id: string; sku: string; qty: number; type: 'SALE' | 'RETURN' };

export async function consume(event: OrderEvent) {
  const stock = await inventoryRepo.getBySku(event.sku);
  const newQty = event.type === 'SALE' ? stock.qty - event.qty : stock.qty + event.qty;
  await inventoryRepo.setQty(event.sku, newQty);
  await publish('inventory.updated', { sku: event.sku, qty: newQty });
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Architecture">
Event-driven integrations with retries, idempotent handlers, and observability (metrics + structured logging).
</Callout>

## Outcome
- 40% fewer stockouts
- Less manual work; updates propagate within seconds across all channels
- Reliable reporting thanks to a single source of truth

<Callout type="success" title="Impact on KPIs">
Higher fulfillment reliability and better customer experience through accurate inventory.
</Callout>

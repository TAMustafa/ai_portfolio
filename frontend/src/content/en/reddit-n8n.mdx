In the fast-paced world of financial services, valuable insights often live in scattered community discussions — buried inside forums, subreddits, and endless comment threads.
Manually tracking these conversations is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often incomplete.

This project shows how I used n8n automation + AI analysis to build a workflow that continuously scans finance-related subreddits, extracts user-reported issues, and summarizes actionable insights.

## Automated Reddit Monitoring using <a href="https://n8n.io/" target="_blank">n8n</a>

I built a workflow in n8n that automates the entire pipeline:

1. Multi-Source Collection
   The system simultaneously queries multiple subreddits, including:

- **r/FinTech** → innovative financial technology insights
- **r/Banking** → traditional banking challenges
- **r/PaymentProcessing** → operational payment issues

2. Data Processing

- Merge & Deduplicate: Combines results, removes duplicates and outdated posts.
- Field Normalization: Standardizes data for consistency.
- Intelligent Filtering: Focuses on problem/solution-oriented posts.

<Callout type="info" title="Filter voor relevante resultaten">
  Filters ensure results are recent (≤3 days old) and only fetch posts that contain the words
  “issue” or “problem” in the text.
</Callout>

3. AI-Powered Analysis
   I integrated Anthropic Claude to:

- Assess each post’s relevance
- Extract key problems and proposed solutions
- Summarize insights into short, actionable outputs
- Detect emerging trends across discussions

4. Structured Output & Storage
   Results are formatted using n8n’s Output Parser and automatically stored in Google Sheets for:

- Clean, searchable structure
- Easy sharing across teams
- A growing knowledge base of user-reported fintech and banking pain points

### Technology Used

- **n8n**: Workflow automation engine (cloud or self-hosted)
- **Reddit API**: Subreddit queries and filtering
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Natural language analysis and summarization
- **Google Sheets**: Persistent structured output
